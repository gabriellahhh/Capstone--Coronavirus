        <h3>What you should know</h3>
        <p class="lead"></p>
        <p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV"</p>

        <h3>How it spreads</h3>
        <p class="lead"></p>
                <p>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. It can spread between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
It also can be spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
